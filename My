Random Solution Generator
def randomSolution(tsp):
 cities = list(range(len(tsp)))
 solution = []
 for i in range(len(tsp)):
 randomCity = cities[random.randint(0, len(cities) - 1)]
 solution.append(randomCity)
 cities.remove(randomCity)
 return solution
Calculating Length of Route
def routeLength(tsp, solution):
 routeLength = 0
 for i in range(len(solution)):
 routeLength += tsp[solution[i - 1]][solution[i]]
 return routeLength
Generating neighbours
def getNeighbours(solution):
 neighbours = []
 for i in range(len(solution)):
 for j in range(i + 1, len(solution)):
 neighbour = solution.copy()
 neighbour[i] = solution[j]
 neighbour[j] = solution[i]
 neighbours.append(neighbour)
