Python: Tips of the Day
Given a predicate function, fn, and a prop string, this curried function will then take an object to inspect by calling the property and passing it to the predicate:

Example:

def tips_check_prop(fn, prop):
  return lambda obj: fn(obj[prop])
check_age = tips_check_prop(lambda x: x >= 25, 'age')
user = {'name': 'Owen', 'age': 25}

print(check_age(user))
Output:

True
